    "### Hashing\n",
    "If every item is where it should be, then the search can use a single comparison to discover the presence of an item. A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later. Each position of the has table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integar value starting at 0. The first hash function, sometimes referred to as the \"remainder method,\" simply takes an item and divides it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value $(h(item) = item\\%(size(lists)))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noe when search for an item, we can simply use the hash function to compute the slot name for the item and then check the hash table to see if it is present. This searching operation is $O(1)$, since a constant amount of time is required to compute the hash value and the index the hash table at that location. The problem is when two or more items share one hash value, there will be a clash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a collection of items, a hash function that maps each item into a unique slot is referred to as a **perfect hash function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase the size of the hash table so that each possible value in the item range can be accommodated. This guarantees that each item will have a unique slot. Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not feasible when the number of possible items is large. For example, if the items were nine-digit Social Security numbers, this method would require almost one billion slots. If we only want to store data for a class of 25 students, we will be wasting an enormous amount of memory."

    "The important thing to remember is that the hash function has to be efficient so that it does not become the dominant part of the storage and search process. If the hash function is too complex, then it becomes more work to compute the slot name than it would be simply do a basic sequential or binary search as described earlier. This would quickly defeat the purpose of hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collision Resolution**\n",
    "One method for resolving collisions looks into the hash table and tries to find another open slot to hold the item that caused the collision. A simple way to do this is to start at the original hash value position and then move in a sequential manner through the slots until we encounter the first slot that is empty. Note that we may need to go back to the first slot (circularly) to cover the entire hash table. This collision resolution process is referred to as open addressing in that it tries to find the next open slot or address in the hash table. By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an open addressing technique called linear probing."
