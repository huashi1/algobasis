    "- P-value: the probability of obataining a test statistic at least as extreme as ours if the null is true and there really is no difference or association in the population of interest. P-values are calculated using different probability distributions depending on the test. A significant result is when the p-value is less than the chosen level of significance(usually 0.05)."
